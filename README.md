Welcome!

My name is Nicholas (he/him), but most people just call me Nick.
I'm just a normal dude with a passion to make nice things.
I also love following the field of ML, usually most things seq2seq.

### Some Projects

- [Oslyn](https://oslyn.io) - AI powered digital bandmate
- [ZeroTwo-Bot](https://zerotwo.bot) & the original PokeCord - Some of the largest Discord bots to exist
- [Lodestone](https://lodestone.cc) - Beautiful open source hosting tool for games such as Minecraft
- [Nuxt-Auth](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/) - Authentication support for one of the world's most popular web frameworks
