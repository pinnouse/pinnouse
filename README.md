### About Me
My name is Nicholas (he/him), but most people just call me Nick.
I'm just a normal dude with a passion to make nice things.
I also love following the field of ML, usually most things seq2seq.

I'm currently working with LLMs and relational programming languages.
I'd also like to share much of what I learn at: [ðŸª´nwong.dev/garden](https://nwong.dev/garden/).
